You are building a FRONTEND-ONLY React application.

STRICT RULES:
- Do NOT create backend
- Do NOT create APIs
- Do NOT use Supabase, Firebase, or any auth service
- Do NOT connect database
- Do NOT generate server code
- Use ONLY React + basic client-side state

---

## GOAL
Build an **Owner Dashboard UI** for a villa/camping booking platform.

The dashboard must be accessible at:
👉 /owner

---

## AUTH (DEMO ONLY — FRONTEND MOCK)

Login Flow:
- Mobile number input
- OTP input

Demo Credentials:
- Mobile Number: 9999999999
- OTP: 000000

Logic:
- If mobile === 9999999999 AND otp === 000000 → login success
- Else → show error message

Store login state in localStorage (e.g. isOwnerLoggedIn = true)

---

## ROUTING

Use React Router:

- /owner → Login screen (if not logged in)
- /owner/dashboard → Owner Dashboard (protected route)

If not logged in, always redirect to /owner

---

## OWNER DASHBOARD UI (FRONTEND ONLY)

### Navigation (mobile-first)
Bottom nav with:
- Dashboard
- Calendar
- Bookings
- Profile

---

### Dashboard Screen
- Property status summary
- Emergency Block toggle (UI only, no logic)
- Today’s status

---

### Calendar Screen
- Monthly calendar UI
- Color codes:
  - Green = Available
  - Red = Booked
  - Yellow = Blocked
- Clicking a date opens a bottom drawer to:
  - Toggle status
  - Change price (UI only)

All data can be stored in React state or mock JSON.

---

### Pricing Screen
- Inputs for:
  - Weekday price
  - Weekend price
- Special date price list (UI only)

---

### Bookings Screen
- List of mock bookings using dummy data

---

### Profile Screen
- Owner name (mock)
- Property name (mock)
- Logout button (clears localStorage)

---

## UI GUIDELINES
- Mobile-first layout
- Clean admin UI
- Use simple CSS or existing UI components if already present
- No animations required

---

## FINAL REMINDER
This is a **UI PROTOTYPE ONLY**.
No backend, no API, no database.
