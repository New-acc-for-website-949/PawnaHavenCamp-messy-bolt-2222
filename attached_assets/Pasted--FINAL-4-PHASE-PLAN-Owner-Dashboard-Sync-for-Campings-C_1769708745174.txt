# ✅ FINAL 4-PHASE PLAN

## Owner Dashboard Sync for **Campings & Cottages**

(**Villas must remain untouched**)

---

## PHASE 1: UNIT AWARENESS IN OWNER DASHBOARD (FOUNDATION)

### Goal

Make the Owner Dashboard fully **unit-aware** for `campings_cottages`, matching Admin + Public flow.

### Tasks

* Detect property category:

  * If `villa` → keep owner dashboard **exactly as-is**
  * If `campings_cottages` → enable unit-based mode

* Add **Unit Selector Dropdown** (required in):

  * Owner Dashboard main calendar page
  * Rates / Pricing page (if separate)

* Unit selector behavior:

  * Lists **all units** of the property (Tent, AC Cottage, Glamping, etc.)
  * Selecting a unit **reloads all data**:

    * Calendar
    * Prices
    * Available / total persons capacity

### DO NOT

* Touch villa owner dashboard logic
* Show property-level calendar for campings_cottages

### Output

* Owner dashboard can switch between units
* Calendar becomes unit-scoped (read-only sync test)

---

## PHASE 2: ALL UNITS MANAGEMENT (OWNER VIEW)

### Goal

Give owners full visibility and control over **all units**, same as Admin.

### Tasks

* Add **“All Units” section** in Owner Dashboard:

  * List all units with:

    * Unit Name
    * Available / Total persons capacity
    * Price per person

* Enable **Edit Unit** (same fields as Admin):

  * Unit Name
  * Available / Total persons capacity
  * Amenities
  * Unit Gallery

* Capacity UI:

  * Format: `available / total persons`
  * Available → green
  * Total → orange

### DO NOT

* Add Activities / Policies / Highlights at unit level
* Allow owners to edit villas via this logic

### Output

* Owners can manage all units visually
* Data matches Admin panel exactly

---

## PHASE 3: PER-UNIT CALENDAR & PRICING CONTROL

### Goal

Ensure owners can fully manage **pricing + availability per unit**, not per property.

### Tasks

* Bind existing **CalendarSync** to:

  * `unit_id` (not property_id)

* Owner can manage **per unit**:

  * Weekday prices
  * Weekend prices
  * Special day prices
  * Block / unblock availability
  * Available persons count per date

* Calendar rules:

  * Reuse existing calendar logic
  * No new calendar component
  * Same pricing behavior as Admin

### DO NOT

* Create a second calendar system
* Allow owners to change villa pricing logic

### Output

* Unit-level calendar fully editable by owner
* Pricing & availability reflect instantly on public site

---

## PHASE 4: UNIVERSAL PROPERTY INFO (SHARED ACROSS UNITS)

### Goal

Allow owners to manage **property-level universal info**, shared by all units.

### Tasks

* Add **Property Info Editor** (campings_cottages only):

  * Activities
  * What you’ll love
  * Privacy policy
  * Property images (gallery)

* Changes apply to:

  * All units
  * Public property details page

### DO NOT

* Duplicate this info per unit
* Allow editing for villas

### Output

* Owners can update universal info once
* Public site reflects changes across all units

---

## NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES

* Villas must remain **100% untouched**
* Unit logic applies **ONLY** to `campings_cottages`
* Owner Dashboard must mirror:

  * Admin Panel
  * Public Website
* Reuse existing:

  * Calendar logic
  * Pricing rules
* No breaking changes to bookings

---

### ✅ FINAL RESULT

Admin, Owner, and Public Website are now **fully in sync** for:

* Units
* Calendar
* Pricing
* Capacity
* Universal property info
