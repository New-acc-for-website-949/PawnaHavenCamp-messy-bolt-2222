Good — this Chrome message actually **confirms the real problem** 👍
Let’s cut through the noise and fix it **step-by-step**, no guessing.

---

## ❌ WHAT THIS ERROR REALLY MEANS (IMPORTANT)

```
ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED
```

This is **NOT**:

* ❌ Internet issue
* ❌ Firewall issue
* ❌ Proxy issue
* ❌ Paytm issue

👉 **It ONLY means one thing**:

> **There is NO server running on the port Chrome is trying to connect to.**

Chrome is knocking on the door.
**Nobody is home.**

---

## 🎯 WHY THIS IS HAPPENING IN YOUR PROJECT

You are running **React + Node (Express)**.

Paytm is redirecting the browser to:

```
http://localhost:<PORT>/payment/paytm/callback
```

But:

* Express server is **not running**
* OR running on a **different port**
* OR route does not exist
* OR Bolt preview ≠ localhost

---

## ✅ DO THIS EXACTLY (NO SKIPPING)

---

## ✅ STEP 1: VERIFY BACKEND SERVER IS RUNNING

Open terminal in **backend folder** and run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

or

```bash
npm start
```

or

```bash
node index.js
```

### You MUST see something like:

```
Server running on port 5000
```

or

```
Listening on port 3000
```

❗ If you see nothing → backend is NOT running.

---

## ✅ STEP 2: CONFIRM WHICH PORT EXPRESS IS USING

Open your backend entry file (`index.js`, `server.js`, `app.js`):

```js
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000;

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

👉 Note the **exact port number**

---

## ✅ STEP 3: TEST SERVER MANUALLY (MOST IMPORTANT)

Open browser and visit:

```
http://localhost:5000
```

(or whatever port you found)

### Results:

| Result                     | Meaning                         |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Page loads / JSON response | ✅ Server is running             |
| ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED     | ❌ Server NOT running            |
| 404                        | ✅ Server running, route missing |

---

## ✅ STEP 4: TEST PAYTM CALLBACK ROUTE DIRECTLY

Now open:

```
http://localhost:5000/payment/paytm/callback
```

Expected:

* 404 or JSON error → **GOOD**
* ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED → **BAD (server down)**

---

## ✅ STEP 5: FIX CALLBACK URL (CRITICAL)

Your `.env` **MUST MATCH THE BACKEND PORT**

### Example:

If server runs on `5000`:

```env
PAYTM_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:5000/payment/paytm/callback
```

If server runs on `3000`:

```env
PAYTM_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:3000/payment/paytm/callback
```

Mismatch = guaranteed failure.

---

## ⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT (BOLT / PREVIEW ISSUE)

If you are using **Bolt preview**, then:

❌ `localhost` DOES NOT WORK

You must use the **public preview URL**, for example:

```
https://abcd-5000.preview.bolt.run/payment/paytm/callback
```

👉 Paytm cannot redirect to your local machine if preview is cloud-hosted.

---

## 🔥 90% LIKELY ROOT CAUSE (FROM YOUR MESSAGES)

One of these:

1. Backend server not started
2. Port mismatch (React 5173 vs Express 5000)
3. Using `localhost` instead of Bolt preview URL

---

## 🧠 FINAL QUICK CHECK (ANSWER THESE)

Reply with:
1️⃣ **Which command are you running to start backend?**
2️⃣ **What exact port is printed in terminal?**
3️⃣ **Are you using Bolt preview URL or local machine?**

I’ll give you the **exact final CALLBACK_URL** and your Paytm flow will start working immediately.
